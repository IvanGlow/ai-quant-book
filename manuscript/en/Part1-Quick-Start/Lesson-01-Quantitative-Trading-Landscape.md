# Lesson 01: The Complete Landscape of Quantitative Trading

> **Goal**: Establish a global perspective first, then dive into details. Understand who the players are in the quantitative world, what strategies exist, why multi-agent architecture is needed, and where this book focuses.

---

## A Typical Scenario (Illustrative)

> Note: The following is a synthesized example to illustrate common phenomena; the numbers are illustrative and do not correspond to any specific individual/account.

In 2020, a quantitative trader developed a machine learning-based strategy for US stocks, primarily trading S&P 500 constituents. The backtest returns were impressive: 80% annualized return, Sharpe ratio of 2.5.

He confidently invested $500,000.

For the first two months, the strategy performed perfectly—going long with the market's upward trend, the account grew 30%. Then the market entered a sideways period, and the strategy started getting whipsawed repeatedly: chasing highs and selling lows, always buying at peaks and selling at troughs. Three months later, the account had drawn down 40%.

He tried adjusting parameters to make the strategy better suited for sideways markets. The result? When the next trend came, the strategy perfectly missed it.

**What went wrong?** It wasn't that the model wasn't good enough, but rather that **a single model cannot excel in all market regimes simultaneously**. Trending markets need momentum strategies, sideways markets need mean reversion, and crisis markets need risk control first. This is a structural contradiction, not something parameter tuning can solve.

But before discussing solutions, let's first establish a comprehensive understanding of quantitative trading.

## 1.1 Three Tiers of Quantitative Trading

When people hear "quantitative trading," different images come to mind:

- **Retail traders** think: Write a Python strategy, automate buying and selling stocks, make money while sleeping
- **Programmers** think: High-frequency trading, nanosecond latency, FPGA, colocation
- **Finance professionals** think: Factor models, risk parity, Smart Beta

They're all talking about "quant," but they're not talking about the same thing at all.

### Classification by Capital Scale and Competitive Dimension

| Tier | Typical Capital | Core Competitive Advantage | Representative Players |
|------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Tier 1: HFT Market Making** | $1B+ | Speed (microsecond-level), hardware, exchange relationships | Citadel Securities, Virtu, Jump |
| **Tier 2: Institutional Quant** | $100M-$10B | Research depth, factor mining, risk control systems | Two Sigma, DE Shaw, High-Flyer, Jiukun |
| **Tier 3: Small/Individual** | <$100M | Flexibility, niche markets, execution discipline | Small hedge funds, proprietary traders |

### Tier 1: HFT Market Making (Opponents You Can't Beat)

**What they do**: Profit from the bid-ask spread, provide liquidity, exploit microsecond information advantages for arbitrage, execute millions of trades per day earning pennies per trade.

**Why you can't beat them**:
```
Your order latency: 50-100 milliseconds (normal network)
Their latency: 5-50 microseconds (exchange colocation)
Difference: 1,000-10,000x
```

When you see a "good price" and prepare to place an order, they've already completed 1,000 trades.

> **Conclusion**: Unless you have hundreds of millions in capital and a top-tier technical team, don't touch HFT. This is an arms race where retail traders always lose.

### Tier 2: Institutional Quant (This Book's Learning Objective)

**What they do**: Medium to low-frequency strategies (holding hours to weeks), multi-factor models, statistical arbitrage, event-driven strategies, strict risk control and portfolio management.

**Why it's worth learning**:
- No speed advantage needed, wins through strategy and risk control
- Methodology is replicable and suitable for systematic learning
- Main application scenario for multi-agent architecture

### Tier 3: Small/Individual

**Advantages**: High flexibility, can pursue small-capacity strategies that big institutions ignore, low cost of experimentation

**Disadvantages**: Limited data and research resources, prone to emotional trading, lack of systematic risk control

**This book's positioning**: Help you build systems using institutional-grade methodology at individual/small team scale.

## 1.2 Major Strategy Types

### Strategy Classification Map

![Strategy Classification Matrix](assets/strategy-matrix.svg)

### Six Major Strategy Types

| Strategy Type | Core Logic | Holding Period | Difficulty |
|---------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **HFT Market Making** | Profit from bid-ask spread, provide liquidity | Seconds-minutes | ★★★★★ |
| **Statistical Arbitrage** | Related assets' price spread reversion | Minutes-days | ★★★★ |
| **Trend Following** | Price momentum persistence | Days-weeks | ★★★ |
| **Mean Reversion** | Price deviation followed by reversion | Hours-days | ★★★ |
| **Event-Driven** | Earnings, M&A, and other events | Days-months | ★★★★ |
| **Multi-Factor** | Combine multiple Alpha factors | Weeks-months | ★★★★ |

### Strategy Lifecycle

**Key insight**: No strategy works forever.

```
Discovery → Validation → Deployment → Decay → Retirement
```

Your system must be able to **continuously evolve**—this is why we need multi-agent architecture.

## 1.3 Why Multi-Agent Architecture

Let's return to the opening story: Why did the single model fail?

### Fatal Flaws of Single Models

Markets switch between different regimes:

| Market Regime | Best Strategy | Single Model Problem |
|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Trending** | Momentum: ride the trend | Gets whipsawed in sideways markets |
| **Sideways** | Mean reversion: buy low, sell high | Misses big moves in trending markets |
| **Crisis** | Risk control first: reduce exposure | May hold full position during crashes |

**Core problem: A single model cannot excel in all regimes simultaneously.** This is a structural flaw, not something parameter tuning can fix.

### Multi-Agent Solution Approach

![Multi-Agent Architecture](assets/multi-agent-architecture.svg)

**Three Core Design Principles:**

1. **Expert Specialization**: Different agents handle different market regimes, each excelling in their domain
2. **Dynamic Routing**: Meta-Agent determines current market regime and routes tasks to corresponding experts
3. **Independent Risk Control**: Risk Agent has veto power—any expert's recommendation must pass risk control

### Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "Multi-agent just means running multiple models" | The key is the **collaboration mechanism**: Who decides? How are conflicts resolved? |
| "A single model tuned to perfection can work" | Market regimes are **structural changes**, not noise—parameter tuning can't solve this |
| "Agents will automatically make money" | Agents are tools; Alpha comes from your strategy design and risk control discipline |
| "Quant is about predicting prices" | Quant is about **managing risk-adjusted returns**—prediction is just one means |

### Applicability Boundaries of Multi-Agent

Every architecture has its boundaries. Multi-agent may underperform single models in these situations:

| Failure Scenario | Reason |
|------------------|--------|
| **Too rapid regime switching** | Meta-Agent detection lags; by the time it switches, the optimal moment has passed |
| **Blurred regime boundaries** | Trending and sideways alternate; each expert is only right half the time |
| **Coordination cost > benefit** | Over-engineering a simple market with complex architecture |

**Core principle**: If your strategy only operates in a single market regime, a single model may be simpler and more effective. Multi-agent's value lies in **cross-regime robustness**.

## 1.4 Multi-Agent Collaboration Example

Let's use a market analysis task to demonstrate how multi-agent collaboration works:

![Agent Collaboration Flow](assets/agent-collaboration-flow.svg)

### Key Collaboration Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Applicable Scenario |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Chain** | Agent A → B → C, sequential execution | Tasks with clear dependencies |
| **DAG (Parallel)** | Multiple agents execute simultaneously, results aggregated | Independent subtasks, like analyzing multiple stocks |
| **Debate** | Multiple agents provide different perspectives on the same problem | Decisions requiring multi-angle analysis |
| **Reflection** | Agent reviews its own or others' output | Improving output quality |
